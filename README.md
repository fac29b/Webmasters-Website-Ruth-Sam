Ruth’s Note 


•	The website wireframe was created by using convo.com. Having a blueprint helps us to visualize the overall structure, content placement, and user interface elements of the website.

•	Sam suggested using semantic HTML such us nav, main, section, and footer instead of div for accessibility and readability purposes.

•	In the header section, the navigation was implemented using the display: flex property. This allowed us to effectively divide it into two distinct sections: the logo and the navbar.

•	The main page features a title, social media icons, a button that leads to the contact page, and a description of our agency.

•	The description text and the social media icons are placed within a flexbox and aligned using the justify-content: space-around property.
